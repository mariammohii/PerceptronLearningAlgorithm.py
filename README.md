# PerceptronLearningAlgorithm.py

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of penguins
Five features were measured from each sample: the bill and flipper length, the gender, the bill depth and the body mass

Implement the Perceptron learning algorithm on a single layer neural networks which can be able to classify a stream of input data to one of a set of predefined classes.
Use the penguins data in both your training and testing processes. (Each class has 50 samples: train NN with 30 non-repeated samples randomly selected, and test it with the remaining 20 samples)

After training
Draw a line that can discriminate between the two learned classes.
Test the classifier with the remaining 20 samples of each selected classes and find confusion matrix and compute overall accuracy.
